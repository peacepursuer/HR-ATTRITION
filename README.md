From the data; 
Employee attrition may be due to low performance ratings, a significant portion of promoted employees is inactive, showing a link between promotion and attrition.
High overtime rates contribute to attrition, affecting 127 out of 237 employees. 
Employees rarely traveling and being single may indicate a need for a change in environment, possibly due to personal life challenges. 
Low monthly income for lab technicians could be a contributing factor. 
Work-Life balance is a reason especially with a low rating in the "Excellent" category (11.39%). 
Addressing this factors especially those that deals with work life balance, job satisfaction and career growth opportunities could possibly reduce attrition and enhance employee well-being.
